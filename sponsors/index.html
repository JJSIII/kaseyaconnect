				<p>Documentation of business systems has real value; everything professional starts and ends with documentation. It enables accuracy, consistency, efficiency, and improvement of business activity. It increases business value. Nonetheless, businesses of all sizes struggle to create and maintain documentation. Missing or bad documentation is the rule, not the exception.</p>

				<p>Our vision is that by understanding the reality of why documenting business systems is difficult for many people we can create solutions that make its value accessible to everyone.</p>

						<h3>Featured Speaker</h3>
						<span class="image-wrap"><img src="/img/speakers/srl.jpg"></span>
						<p>Sugar Ray Leonard is one of the legendary sports icons of the 20th century whose very name epitomizes boxing and conjures the image of a champion. Leonard's brutally honest and uplifting presentation reveals the complex man behind the boxer. The Olympic hero, multichampionship winner and beloved athlete presents his own personal battle with depression, rage, addiction and greed. With honesty, humor and hard-won perspective, Leonard comes to terms with both triumph and struggle-and presents a gripping portrait of remarkable strength, courage and resilience, both in and out of the ring.</p>

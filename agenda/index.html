											<h3>Kaseya Security Products and Integration</h3>
											<span class="speaker">Jeff Keyes, Product  Manager &bull; Scott Brackett, Senior Program Manager</span>
											<span class="location"><a href="/floor-map/">Acacia Ballroom 1</a></span>
										  <p>This technical session will explore the various security solutions available from Kaseya and how they map to your supported systems.

											<h3>Scaling Services for Profitability</h3>

											<span class="location"><a href="/floor-map/">Four Seasons Ballroom</a></span>
											<p>Have you considered service delivery for scale and the functionality needed to execute it?

											<h3>Transitioning from a Reactive Break-Fix Marketplace to a Proactive Automated Model</h3>
											<span class="speaker">Vito Pietrapertosa &amp; Emanuele Briganti, PC System, Italy</span>
											<span class="location"><a href="/floor-map/">Acacia Ballroom 2</a></span>
											<p>Italy is no stranger to the reactive model of IT services.  With a majority of companies with fewer than 50 personal computers and 5 servers, the approach to outsourced IT systems administration has been one of "get the IT guy over here to fix it". Demonstrating the value of automated IT services has been an arduous process in Italy, but one that we have solved by demonstrating the value of a comprehensive IT service. Join me for this session as I discuss this transformation and provide you with some insight and ideas on how you can leverage this for your own market.</p>

											<h3>Build Mind Share and Wallet Share with Quarterly Service Reviews</h3>
											<span class="speaker"><a href="/speakers/#john-k">John Kilian</a>, Service Architect at AntFarm, Inc.</span>
											<span class="location"><a href="/floor-map/">Palm Room</a></span>
										  <p>Options for outsourcing IT management and have grown dramatically over the past several years.  Every day, there is someone new knocking on your client’s door trying to take them away from you. Strong account relationships built on mutual trust and two-way communications foster both high retention rates and referrals for new clients. While the daily service transactions that occur in a managed services relationship demonstrate your ability to execute well, they don’t communicate everything you are doing to ensure IT is meeting the needs of your client’s business.  Much of the effort is behind the scenes. Your clients must understand the full value you provide.  You need to be able to understand their IT concerns.  Quarterly Service Reviews provide a forum to discuss both of these areas.</p>

Garrett Mackey, one of the many Remote Engineers at Shield Watch, answered the call. Mike on the other side said “Garrett, I can’t access one of our files from the server, it seems like it is corrupted.” Following routine procedure, Garrett realized that this 50 employee healthcare facility has just been hit by Cryptolocker. Listen to the CEO of Shield Watch, Pratik Roychoudhury, talk about what happened next and how Kaseya’s RMM tool was central to their recovery efforts. <br><br>A Kaseya client since 2008, Pratik provides a unique perspective on how he chooses technology partners for his company and turns upside down conventional selection criteria based on product functionality, ease-of-use, etc. Pratik uses a People, Process, Technology and Evolution model as his defining criteria for partner selection and he likes to stick to partner decisions for the long haul and allows his employees to learn and evolve as the partner companies evolve. It is Kaseya’s ability to keep evolving and redesigning its service offerings to suit the changing needs of the MSP market that has enabled Shield Watch to partner with Kaseya for the last six years and to continue this partnership for many more years to come.">View Details</a></td>
